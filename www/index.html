  <h1>Embedded Engine Demo</h1>
  <p>Here's a simple demo bouncing pixel "game" built in the engine, it's not much of a game but it'll do as a simple
    demo. I didn't make something overly complicated because I'd rather spend time working on the engine, not the demo.
    I'll make a better game that demonstrates all the features of the engine in a later ship.

  <p>Use <kbd>WASD</kbd> or arrow keys to move the dot and <kbd>CTRL+Scroll</kbd> to zoom in/out.</p>
  <p>The jitteriness is because this is a low-resolution display (128x64) and it is monochrome (ie black OR white,
    nothing in between) so I can't do antialiasing. These are hard constraints and I can't do anything about them as
    they're the specs of the SSD1306 display (which is what the game is displayed on if you run it on the Pico).</p>
